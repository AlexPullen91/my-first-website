# Mambo

Mambo is a business idea that a friend of mine has come up with and it needs a website.

It will be a hobbyist's football filming service based in Manchester, England. You sign up and pay a fee for one game to be recorded. Mambo sends down a camera operator who sets up a couple of static cameras and they operate a third camera to closely follow the action. Once the game is over the footage is prepared and edited to then be sent directly to the user within 24 hours.

The primary aim of the website is to showcase what the service does and what the final product looks like, ultimately attracting new customers.

# UX

This website will be used by people in a rather large age bracket spanning early teens all the way up to people in their 50s, therefore it will need to be simple to use with clearly laid out, accessible information.

According to the [English Football Association's](http://www.thefa.com/get-involved/player/5-a-side-and-futsal) website over 1.5 million adults play small sided football every week, with 30,000 teams playing in organised and competitive small sided leagues. The primary user will likely be men in their late teens, 20s and 30s who want to be able to watch back footage of their games and share it with team mates, friends and family.

It will be a single page site with a minimalist approach and green colour scheme that compliments the large photo backdrop of amatuer football pitches. Scrolling down will reveal more of the image and more site content. 

Upon visiting ,the user will be greeted with a brief outline of what mambo is in very large comfortaa font. They will scroll down to reveal a video section, what we do section, pricing section and contact section.
